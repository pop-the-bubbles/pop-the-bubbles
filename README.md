## About my product...
Pop the Bubbles is a 2D arcade platformer score-based game where you play as a robot trying to pop all bubbles before your bubbles cover everything. You pop bubbles to earn points; the more you pop, the higher your score. Unfortunately, there’s a time limit, when the clock stops ticking, it’s game over. To increase the time limit, there are special bubbles that when you pop them, give you more time, but that doesn’t mean it stops the clock from ticking. But if you’re too slow, there’s the special Snail bubble, which makes the bubbles go slow for a small amount of time so you can pop them all. Good luck if you’re trying to get the highest score, it may be easy at first, but Bubbles slowly rise more and more faster as well as the difficulty.
